# Machine Learning for Reactive Dissolution in Porous Media

## Introduction

This repository contains a PyTorch (Lightning) implementation of three different deep learning algorithms for reactive dissolution in porous media. It includes the following algorithms:

- Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM)
- U-Shaped Fourier Neural Operator (U-FNO)
- Temporal Attention Unit (TAU)

## Main Requirements

- PyTorch-Lightning
- OpenSTL (for TAU)
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- Jupyter

Please refer to [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) for more details.

## Training
